Challenge:
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Using http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php I grabbed "All Earthquakes for the past 7 days" JSON data.
Used leaflet to plot, data markers represent the earthquake's magnitude by their size and the earthquake's depth by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear more significant, and earthquakes with greater depth  appear darker in color.

When the circle markers are clicked, they provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

The legend shows the depth of the earthquake via color scale.

I will post the quick link to the deployed site once it loads.
