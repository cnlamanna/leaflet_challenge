Using http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php I grabbed "All Earthquakes for the past 7 days" JSON data.
Used leaflet to plot, data markers represent the earthquake's magnitude by their size and the earthquake's depth by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear more significant, and earthquakes with greater depth  appear darker in color.

When the circle markers are clicked, they provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

The legend shows the depth of the earthquake via color scale.

I will post the quick link to the deployed site once it loads.
