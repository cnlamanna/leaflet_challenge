# leaflet_challenge
Using http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php I grabbed "All Earthquakes for the past 7 days" json data.
Used leaflet to plot, data markers represent the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth  appear darker in color.

When the circle markers are clicked, they provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

The legend shows the depth of the earthquake via color scale.

I will post quick link of deployed site once it loads.
